Tesseract OCR have a python API and it is open source. Firstly, we will do installation of it. It pretty simple and depend on you OS. You can find manual and files to download for installation [here](https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347520&p=4121425).\n\n\n### LIMITATIONS OF PYTESSERACT\n\nTesseract works best when there is a clean segmentation of the foreground text from the background. In practice, it can be extremely challenging to guarantee these types of setups. There are a variety of reasons you might not get good quality output from Tesseract like if the image has noise on the background. The better the image quality (size, contrast, lightning) the better the recognition result. It requires a bit of preprocessing to improve the OCR results, images need to be scaled appropriately, have as much image contrast as possible, and the text must be horizontally aligned. Tesseract OCR is quite powerful but does have the following limitations.\n\n__Tesseract limitations summed in the list.__\n<ul>\n  <li>The OCR is not as accurate as some commercial solutions available to us.</li>\n  <li>Doesn't do well with images affected by artifacts including partial occlusion, distorted perspective, and complex background.</li>\n  <li>It is not capable of recognizing handwriting.</li>\n  <li>It may find gibberish and report this as OCR output.</li>\n  <li>If a document contains languages outside of those given in the -l LANG arguments, results may be poor.</li>  \n  <li>It is not always good at analyzing the natural reading order of documents. For example, it may fail to recognize that a document contains two columns, and may try to join text across columns.</li>\n  <li>Poor quality scans may produce poor quality OCR.</li>\n  <li>It does not expose information about what font family text belongs to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### EXTRACT NUMBER PLATE TEXT FROM IMAGE\n\nFirstly, we will load our image and convert to array. Crop our bounding box with coordinates of it. We will identify region of interest (ROI) and have look at our cropped image *Figure 15*.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import cv2 \nimport pytesseract\n\npath = \"/kaggle/input/us-license-plates-image-classification/new plates/test/ALABAMA/3.jpg\"\nimg = cv2.imread(path)\n\n# Adding custom options\ncustom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6'\npytesseract.image_to_string(img, config=custom_config)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-12T18:49:14.394546Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-12T18:49:14.394995Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-12T18:49:14.759737Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-12T18:49:14.394962Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-12T18:49:14.758471Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With use of tesseract, we will extract the text from the mage.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Compare the performance with Spark OCR\nhttps://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/ocr","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Improve the performance by utilizing GPU","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Ultimate Challenge: Hand-made OCR optimized for license Plate Recognition (good to have)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ","metadata":{}}]}
