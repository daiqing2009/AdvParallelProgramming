## Question 1
Write a parallel MPI program which generates a sequence of N random numbers, each between 0 and 1, on each of its p processes.

Then implement a sorting algorithm where each process sorts the sequence of numbers it has, then distributes parts of it to the other processes so that at the end process 0 has the random numbers between 0 and 1/p, process 1 has numbers between 1/p and 2/p, and so on until the last process has numbers between (p-1)/p and 1
